# 🎮 Battleship Game

A classic two-player Battleship game implemented on one screen, with animations, sound effects, and a clean interactive interface. Players take turns placing ships, launching attacks, and racing to sink each other’s fleets.



🚀 How to Play

Start the Game

No command-line arguments are required.

Launch the program and click the Start button.

Place Your Ships

Player 1 places ships first by clicking cells on their personal board.

The program provides hints and checks validity (e.g., correct orientation, no overlap, within bounds).

Invalid choices will prompt the player to try again.

Once Player 1 finishes, Player 2 places their ships.

Begin Battle

Players take turns attacking cells on the opponent’s board.

Hit: Green circle 🎯

Miss: Black square ❌

Winning the Game

The first player to sink all enemy ships is declared the winner.

A winning message appears along with applause 👏.
